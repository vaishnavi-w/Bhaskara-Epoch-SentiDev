# Student Courses Review App

The Student Courses Review App is a web application built using Dash, a Python framework for creating interactive web applications. This app allows students to review courses and provides insights into course ratings and sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **Course Reviews:** Students can select a course, enter their name, give a rating (1-5), and provide a review comment. They can submit their reviews, which are used to calculate the average course rating.

- **Course Insights:** The app provides insights in the form of graphs. It displays a bar chart showing the average ratings of all courses, helping users compare courses easily.

- **Sentiment Analysis:** The app performs sentiment analysis on review comments to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. Users can view sentiment distribution charts for each course.
